## Method developement for the helical reconstruction

Many macromolecules in biological systems exist in the form of helical polymers, such as amyloid fibrils, microtubule, actin, bacteria pili, viruses, and phage tails. 3D reconstruction of these helical polymers is essential to elucidate the structure-function relationships and provide an understanding of related diseases at the atomic level, leading to potential drug discovery. Helical reconstruction, in contrast to conventional cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) single-particle reconstruction, continues to present significant challenges. These challenges arise due to the relatively low molecular weight of each subunit and the special helical symmetry inherent in polymer structures. Before 3D reconstruction of helical polymers, there are three critical factors that need to be estimated: heterogeneity, the ab initio model, and helical parameters. These factors are intricately interrelated, complicating the precise estimation of them. My main theis work is to develop the computational tools to estimate all these essential parameters to enable a successful reconstruction of the helical structure.

## Development for cryoVR

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) has emerged as a revolutionary tool for solving the structure of various proteins while preserving their near-native states. However, the availability of equipment, time, and the cost needed for training can substantially limit the opportunity for hands-on training on cryoEM procedures. Modern virtual reality (VR) technology has made the virtual experience much more realistic and affordable. VR devices’ high-fidelity simulated visual and audio sensations can create an immersive feeling of presence in a virtual environment for a user. VR training can reduce training costs, especially when traditional training depends on interactive instructions of experts and can suffer from the breakdown of devices used during training. Therefore, we developed a VR-based training system, CryoVR, to assist trainees in familiarizing themselves with the cryoEM operation procedures before the training on expensive and delicate real-world cryoEM equipment. 

My responsibility for the cryoVR project is to build the 3D models for all the equipment in our cryoVR environment, conducting quality assessment and disseminate the CryoVR in different places
