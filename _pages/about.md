Daoyi Li personal website
======
This is Daoyi Li the last year PhD student in [Wen Jiang's lab](https://jiang.bio.purdue.edu/) studying [Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/structural/index.html) in Purdue University. 

<span style="color: red;">I am currently looking for research position in both academia and industry (researtch scientist, postdoc...)</span>

Personal interest
======
I have been conducting research on method development for cryo-EM image analysis for the past five years. During this time, I have observed a trend toward cryo-EM image analysis becoming increasingly streamlined. This evolution reminds me of the history of DNA sequencing, which transitioned from Sanger sequencing to the high-throughput sequencing technologies we use today. I believe that the future of cryo-EM will follow a similar trajectory, evolving from solving individual cryo-EM structures to enabling high-throughput structuromics.

With that in mind, I am particularly enthusiastic about method development for high-throughput, inference-based cryo-EM structure determination rather than focusing solely on pushing structural resolution by a few more angstroms. Below are some research topics that align with my interests:

1. Developing a real-time protein detection method for rapid protein structure identification.
2. Advancing in situ structuromics using cryo-ET.
3. Creating foundational models that can support multiple tasks, such as classification, object detection, and particle picking.
